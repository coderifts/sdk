Do not send a single-file subset when other contract files also change.\n\nBranch on `execution_action` only. Do not branch on `decision` and do not branch on `safe_for_agent` (not_for_control_flow_use_execution_action). Canonical `execution_action` values: CONTINUE, CONTINUE_WITH_MONITORING, REQUEST_APPROVAL, STOP.\n\nAn unrecognised `execution_action` is not permission: fail closed (halt or re-preflight). Well-known code: `not_permission_fail_closed`.\n\nWhen `execution_action` is REQUEST_APPROVAL or STOP, surface the detected patterns and the blast radius, and propose the safer path \u2014 deprecate-then-remove, an additive change, or a new version \u2014 rather than shipping the break.\n\n`CONTINUE_WITH_MONITORING` requires a wired monitoring sink (`monitoringSinkWired`). It is not \"proceed with caution\" without monitoring.\n\nDo not call `preflight_change_set` for: a documentation-only change (README, guides, comments) with no contract artifact content change; a static readiness score (a different capability, not a change-set decision); or to verify a receipt you already hold (that is `verify_receipt` \u2014 see the companion-tools rule).\n\nIf you already hold a chain receipt and only need authenticity/lifecycle: `verify_receipt`. If you need a past decision by id: `get_decision_details`. Neither replaces preflight for a new change set.\n\nThe CodeRifts MCP server exposes exactly three tools \u2014 `preflight_change_set`, `verify_receipt`, `get_decision_details`. Do not invent or assume others.\n\nA receipt authorizes ONE operation: a merge receipt does not authorize a deploy. Before a different operation (deploy, publish), call `preflight_change_set` with `context.operation` set to that operation \u2014 reusing a differently-scoped receipt is not permitted and will fail at the gate.\n\nA stale or superseded receipt on a changed head requires a NEW preflight \u2014 `verify_receipt` cannot re-diff.\n\nFor mutating tools, put only the guarded version in the agent's tool table; keep the raw handler host-only and unreachable from that table. How you name tools is yours \u2014 this is a reachability property, not a product rename of host tools. CodeRifts cannot see or stop a raw call the host makes outside the table it returns; adopt this as a host convention, not as a guarantee from the package.\n\nCodeRifts reports a governance decision and `execution_action`; it does not by itself block merges. Blocking requires separate repository configuration (required status checks, enforcement) that this rule file does not set.\n\nTo act (mutate a contract, merge, deploy, or publish): call `preflight_change_set` with `preflight_mode` authorize. Analyze is informational \u2014 risk only, `may_execute` is always false \u2014 and is not permission. Read `execution_action` on the `decision_result` envelope.\n\nBefore acting under a held receipt: call `verify_receipt` with the intended `context` (operation, environment, repository, branch, pull_request) for THIS attempt. Do not act on a receipt whose scope does not match.\n\nAct only when `currently_authorized` is true (`control_envelope.receipt_view.currently_authorized`). A valid-looking token is not permission if `currently_authorized` is false or omitted.\n\nCommit / CAS evidence is a separate measurement (`commit_observation` on GuardOutcome). It is not a substitute for authorize + `currently_authorized`. Production hosts that want the fail-closed conjunction lock it with `profile: ENFORCING_STRICT` on withCodeRifts.\n\nIf the host requests an execution grant (opt-in `include_execution_grant`), the grant is bound to operation + target + after-payload (`scope_hash`) and is short-lived \u2014 never reuse it after the after-payload changes.\n\nAn ATOMIC-profile grant carries `state_nonce` and is single-use at the executor \u2014 if the executor has consumed the nonce, re-preflight; do not retry the same grant.\n\nWith a proven tenant\u2194repo binding you may request `derivation:\"server\"` instead of assembling `artifacts[]` yourself (`context.repository` + `context.base` + `context.head` required; caller-supplied artifacts are rejected on that path).\n\nA commit is only proven when an executor attestation verifies (customer-held executor key, `cas_evidence: executor_attested`); otherwise say \"authorized, commit not proven\".";
